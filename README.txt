Objective:
Program generates five lines of randomly generated animal poetry.
User will be shown a GUI, where the user will click on a
"Generate" button. The button will generate five lines onto the GUI and
will be visible to the user.
How:
Using multiple classes of noun-phrases,verb-phrases, and object-phrases, we use
the elementary structure of grammar creating english sentences. The program will sort out articles and will assign accordingly 
based off parameters involving the letters that make up the objects, and nouns/adjectives.
GUI will be created on a canvas that will have widgets connected the functions which create the poetry.
